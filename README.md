## Project Overview

This project is designed to help analyze and monitor energy consumption across multiple sites, with data segmented by region and time. The main goals of the project are:
- **Energy Demand Tracking**: Understand how energy demand varies over time for each site.
- **Consumption Patterns**: Analyze consumption data by different regions and sites.
- **Data Visualization**: Use Power BI to create insightful, interactive dashboards that allow stakeholders to monitor energy usage and trends easily.

The dataset used contains energy consumption data recorded at half-hour intervals across different sites and regions. The analysis includes the creation of visualizations to help business leaders make data-driven decisions regarding energy usage.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For data visualization, dashboard creation, and reporting.
- **Excel**: For data preparation and cleaning, especially when integrating various data sources.
- **Power Query**: For data transformation and cleaning in Power BI.
- **Git**: Version control and collaboration management.
